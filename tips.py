# Tips for advent of code, basic leetcode and online assessments

# BASIC
# handle out of bounds cases when iterating (moving) over a grid or n-dimensional array
# check every "if" case is handled and each branch exits/continues correctly if in a loop
# return early for optmisiation or use lazy evaluation
# use copy.deepcopy to keep a copy to modify whilst referencing the original array/object (good changing elements depend on each other)
# look for math shortcuts such as n^, modulus (%),
